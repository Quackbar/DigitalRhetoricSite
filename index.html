									<h2 class="major">The Backstory</h2>
									<p>When you think of Computer Science you should think of these three people: Grace Hopper, Ada Lovelace, and Alan Turing. They are the beginning and in many ways the end of computer science. Each of these people contributing more to computer science than anyone else who has ever lived. Each of them laying down the cornerstone concepts that all software is based around, the concepts every CS student or professional needs to be able to grasp in order to contribute to anything. Each of them having more of an effect on our modern society than probably any other person to have ever lived. But all of them marginalized in their time and place.</p>

									<p>Ada Lovelace, Daughter of Lord Byron, inventing and sharing the concept of the first computer in a time when women were never meant to talk. Grace Hopper being a leader and innovator in the United States Navy. In a time when Female leadership was unconventional to say the least.  Alan Turing, inventor of the Turing machine a.k.a every modern computer, a gay man in a time when that could and would get him killed.</p>

									<h2 class="major">What Has Changed</h2>
									<p>Computer Science has a rich heritage of contributors from all associations, genders, and peoples. And yet it has become one of the more non-diverse workforces on the planet. This a change that happened during fairly suddenly in the 1970-90s. As more women were entering fields such as nursing and teaching men came to fill the gap in these tech industries. Also as garage band companies like Microsoft and Apple started to become more public there was a huge shift in what people thought of programmers. Ultimately this all leads to a bit of a mono-culture workforce. All of a sudden the public's idea of a programmer became an image of a white male and that became a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

								<div class="inner" style="width: 50%;">
										<p>Wages rose and business boomed in the various elemental valleys of the world. But only one people group really widely benefited from this prosperity. It makes you wonder why this is though. Why didn't more people of diverse backing join this accelerating monetary machine. The best reason is that it was already poisonous. People would either not be hired into these companies unless they fit the typecasting requirements or they would be harassed by their fellow employees until they left on their own. Also the culture of these companies catered first and foremost to straight men. From corporate sex parties to non-family friendly work hours anyone not willing to conform to the lifestyle would have a difficult time truly becomming part of the community.</p>

										<h2 class="major">With Non-Diverse Teams Come Bad Products</h2>
										<p>
												The image of a developer has been cemented into the form of a white male and unfortunately with every potential developer who meets that bill and decides to go into computer science that form if hardened further. This is in and of itself a fairly large problem but beyond that comes a problem of products. Although not every person will be affected by the disparity of developer hires everyone WILL be affected by the products they make. The scantily clad support characters, the demeaning story telling, and the openly sexist algorithms put forward by these teams are allowing this problem to creep into the rest of society through services that we are literally addicted to.

											<p>This toxicity creap threatens every member of society in some way or another. Games have already been a huge point of contention across many different people groups. Being accused of almost every form of bigotry. And although there are changes and progress in some development teams, without an injection of diversity these teams will always have trouble self-diagnosing. And ultimately trying to rely on the work of online activists isn't a good or permanent solution. It only introduces more and more disagreements and hateful subcultures that will inevitably support and defend the decisions of these teams. Its always better to be proactive. Especially in a society where right and wrong is constantly being revealed in new ways.
